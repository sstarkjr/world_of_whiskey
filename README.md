This webscraper project is my take on the tutorial by John Watson Rooney 
found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCuPv3tf2Hg&ab_channel=JohnWatsonRooney

This project aggregates the Whiskeys of the World found on The Whisky Exchange website \
found here: https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/

The whiskeys are scraped into a DataFrame that is stored as a CSV in the 'output' directory. Two versions are saved, 
one for the latest run, and one in a folder with the current timestamp. This functionality preserves the csv so that one
version is always the latest version and the other version will not be overwritten if the structure of the website 
changes.
