This webscraper project is my take on the tutorial by John Watson Rooney 
found here: [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCuPv3tf2Hg&ab_channel=JohnWatsonRooney)

This project aggregates the Whiskeys of the World found on The Whisky Exchange website \

The whiskeys are scraped into a pandas DataFrame that is stored as a CSV in the 'output' directory. Two versions are 
saved, one for the latest run, and one in a folder with the current timestamp. I included this functionality so that 
historical scrapes are always preserved.
